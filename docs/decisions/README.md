# Decisions

Logged architectural decisions. Each entry records a decision with its rationale; the entry is
immutable once accepted, and a superseding decision links back to the one it replaces.

Decisions are reserved for choices with real trade-offs: rejected alternatives, load-bearing
invariants, or constraints that bind the codebase going forward. Housekeeping notes (e.g., "this
archive item is subsumed by an existing surface") do not warrant a decisions entry; record the
reason inline at the point it matters.

## File Naming

`kebab-case.md`. The name describes the decision, not when it was made; the date lives inside the
file. Existing example: `integral-representation.md`.

## Shape

There is no fixed template. The existing `integral-representation.md` is the reference for shape:
title, date, status, the model or findings that shaped the decision, the decision itself, and the
consequences that follow. Let the subject drive the structure; a decision with no rejected
alternative or no load-bearing invariant probably should not be a decision entry.
