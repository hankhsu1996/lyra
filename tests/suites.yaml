# Test suite definitions
#
# Suites define backend + test selection (closed contracts for CI).
# Patterns are regex substrings matched against relative paths.
# Empty include_regex = all YAML files. Exclude wins over include.
#
# Naming convention for test files:
#   *_four_state.yaml      - 4-state only (excluded from jit_two_state)
#   *_two_state.yaml       - Cross-mode invariant (runs in BOTH modes)
#   *_two_state_only.yaml  - Semantic diff (excluded from jit_dev)
#   four_state/*.yaml      - 4-state only directory (excluded from jit_two_state)
