# Documentation Guidelines

## Core Principles

1. **Concise over complete** - Capture decisions and rationale, not implementation details
2. **No code unless necessary** - If explanation suffices, skip the example. If needed, use pseudocode
3. **Integrate, don't append** - Each edit should reorganize, not just add to the end
4. **Target length: 200-400 lines per doc** - If longer, split into focused documents

## Before Adding Content

Ask:

- Is this a decision/philosophy, or implementation detail? (Only the former belongs here)
- Does this duplicate existing content? (If yes, merge instead)
- Where does this fit in the current structure? (Never default to appending)

## When Editing

1. Read the entire document first
2. Find the right location for new content
3. Remove or condense redundant sections
4. Reorganize headings if structure has drifted

## Anti-Patterns

- Appending discussion logs verbatim
- Code examples longer than 5 lines
- Implementation details that belong in code comments
- Letting a document grow past 500 lines without splitting
