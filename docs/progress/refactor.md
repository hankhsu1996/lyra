# Refactor

Tracks architectural debt and cleanup work that has been deferred because the immediate task did not
need it -- but that we have agreed should land eventually. Distinct from the per-feature progress
files (which track in-flight language-feature work); this file is the queue of "architecturally we
know this is wrong, here is the target shape, here is what triggers picking it up".

Each entry states:

- The current shape (what is awkward today)
- The target shape (what it should look like)
- The trigger (when to pick it up)

Entries get checked off as their PRs land. When the last entry lands, the file is deleted.

## Sub-Steps

- [ ] R1 -- Promote `Builtins` (canonical TypeIds for `int`, `bit[0]`, `string`, `void`, `realtime`)
      out of `UnitLoweringState` and onto `mir::CompilationUnit`. Today the table lives on the HIR
      -> MIR lowering state, which makes the canonical TypeIds invisible to any other MIR consumer.
      The literal-synthesis helpers that sit on `UnitLoweringState` (currently just
      `MakeInt32LiteralExpr`, sibling forms expected) follow it: they move into `lyra::mir` as free
      functions taking a `mir::CompilationUnit&`. **Why deferred**: no non-HIR-to-MIR consumer
      exists today; the lowering-state-scoped factory is sufficient until a second consumer arrives.
      **Trigger**: when a MIR-to-LLVM lowering (or a MIR-level optimization pass) first needs the
      canonical builtin TypeIds; at that point the per-consumer copy temptation is the smell that
      forces this move.

- [ ] R2 -- Realign the `Var<T>` wrapping gate so the cpp backend stops mixing structural type
      classification with runtime-capability gating. Today `IsObservableScalarType` returns true
      only for `IsIntegralPacked()` and the backend uses it to silently skip the wrapper for every
      other value type (`string`, `real`, unpacked array). The two questions it tangles together --
      "should this field semantically be a value slot at all (vs an object / sub-hierarchy)?" and
      "does the runtime currently support change-tracking for this T?" -- have different homes: the
      first is an intrinsic MIR type classification (value family vs object family); the second is a
      runtime capability gap that should manifest as an explicit `kUnsupported...` diagnostic at the
      AST -> HIR / HIR -> MIR sensitivity-lowering sites when a `@(...)`, `wait`, or `always_comb`
      sensitivity references a type whose `Var<T>` specialization does not yet exist. Target shape:
      backend wraps every value-typed field uniformly in `Var<T>`, leaving object- family fields
      plain; runtime grows minimal `Var<String>` / `Var<double>` / `Var<vector<T>>` specializations
      (storage + assign at first, waiter paths throw `kUnsupportedFeature` until filled in); AST ->
      HIR rejects the unsupported sensitivity uses upstream with a source span. The backend then
      becomes a pure renderer, never asking a capability question. **Why deferred**: backend
      currently sidesteps the issue silently and the sensitivity rejection at AST -> HIR for
      non-integral leaves already keeps things consistent in practice; the proper fix touches
      runtime, sensitivity lowering, and backend rendering together. **Trigger**: when the first
      non-integral runtime change-tracking surface lands (named-event subscription, string
      `wait (s == "x")`, real value-change detection) -- at that moment the `IsObservableScalarType`
      shortcut becomes actively wrong and the layering fix has to happen alongside.

- [ ] R3 -- Collapse the runtime's dual hierarchy into a single object tree. Today two parallel
      trees exist: the C++ object-ownership tree (each emitted scope class owns its children by
      `unique_ptr` and holds their state and process bodies) and a `RuntimeScope` tree the engine
      builds during `Bind` by mirroring it (name, kind, parent, children, and the process list the
      scheduler walks). `Bind` is the mirroring step. This is the dual-representation /
      separate-hierarchy-models shape `hierarchy_and_generate.md` (Core Invariant 4, Forbidden
      Shapes) forbids: no consumer may own a topology representation parallel to the object tree. It
      also leaves the emitted scope classes inconsistent -- unit-root classes extend `Module` and
      each redeclare `services_`, while generate-scope classes are bare -- and leaves the
      observed-region (combinational settle) machinery on `Module` only, so a process in a nested
      instance or generate scope cannot drain (combinational logic inside a child instance or
      generate block is unsupported). Target shape: one tree. A single runtime base -- the hierarchy
      node, named after the LRM VPI object model (`scope` base, with `instance` and `gen scope`
      specializations) -- carries name, kind, parent, child links, the process list, and
      `services_`; every emitted scope class extends it and stays thin (state plus process bodies);
      the engine walks the real object tree through the base's interface; `RuntimeScope` dissolves
      into the base. `services_` then lives once, generate-scope classes stop being bare, and the
      observed-region machinery composes for every scope. **Why deferred**: the instance-array work
      does not need it, and it is a runtime-wide change touching the scheduling walk, the bind
      protocol, process ownership, and the emit shape -- too large to fold into a feature PR.
      **Trigger**: the next cut (agreed); the bind-time mirroring is the smell that forces it.

- [ ] R4 -- Store an instance array as a fixed-size array, not a growable vector with a side dim
      list. Today `Child c[2][3]` lowers to a nested `VectorType` (`std::vector`) and the
      per-dimension element counts ride as a separate `dims` list on the construct statement; the
      backend peels that list into nested container loops at render time. The extent is a
      compile-time constant, so the storage should be a fixed-size array (`std::array`) carrying its
      extent on each type layer -- a new array type symmetric with `VectorType`, with the count
      living in the type (one container layer per dimension) rather than in a side list. Each
      pre-sized slot is then assigned directly, with no grow step. This is the same
      size-belongs-in-the-type, one-layer-per-dimension shape the unpacked-array decision fixes; the
      flat dim list is the rejected form. **Why deferred**: the vector form is behaviorally correct
      and the instance-array feature ships on it; the array-type refinement is contained but not
      needed for correctness. **Trigger**: alongside R3's emit rework, or when a second fixed-extent
      object-collection consumer appears.

## Out of Scope

- Per-feature workstreams. Those live in the dedicated feature files (`control-flow.md`,
  `operators.md`, etc.).
- One-PR cleanups with no architectural shift. Those land directly without a tracking entry.
- The pre-reset surface re-implementation backlog. That lives in `architecture-reset.md`.
