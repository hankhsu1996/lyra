# Commit

Create a commit following the project format.

## STOP: Check Branch First

**You are NOT allowed to commit on main.** Before doing ANYTHING else:

1. Check the current branch in the Context section below
2. If on `main`, STOP and ask the user for a branch name using AskUserQuestion
3. Create the branch with `git switch -c <branch-name>` BEFORE any other steps

Do NOT proceed with formatting or staging until you are on a feature branch.

## Context

- **Current branch:** !`git branch --show-current`
- **Git status:** !`git status --short`
- **Staged diff:** !`git diff --cached`
- **Unstaged diff:** !`git diff`

## Pre-commit Checks

Before committing, format ALL files in the codebase (format is fast, so we run it on everything):

1. **C++ files** - Format all source files:

   ```bash
   find src include -name '*.cpp' -o -name '*.hpp' | xargs clang-format -i
   ```

2. **Documentation** - Format all markdown files:

   ```bash
   npx prettier --write "**/*.md"
   ```

3. **Bazel files** - Format all Bazel files:

   ```bash
   buildifier -r .
   ```

## Commit Format

```
<Summary starting with verb, 50 chars or less>

- Bullet point explaining what changed
- Another bullet point if needed (2-5 total)
```

Bullet points should describe **what changed**, not background context or why the old state was bad.

**CRITICAL: Do NOT add attribution.** No "Generated with Claude Code", no "Co-Authored-By", no author credits. These duplicate badly when squash-merging. The commit message should ONLY contain the summary line and bullet points.

**IMPORTANT: Focus on features, not implementation journey.** Don't reference internal tracking like "Phase 1", "Step 2", or planning documents.

## Branch Rules

**Branch name format:** `<type>/<short-description>`

- **Types:** `feature`, `bugfix`, `refactor`, `release`, `chore`, `docs`
- Use kebab-case: `aaa-bbb-ccc`
- Keep short (~5 words max)

**Examples:**

- `feature/user-auth`
- `bugfix/null-pointer-crash`
- `refactor/split-codegen` (behavior-preserving restructuring)
- `chore/update-deps` (CI changes go here)
- `docs/api-reference`

## Instructions

1. **Check branch first** - See "STOP: Check Branch First" section above. Do NOT skip this.
2. Format all files (C++, markdown, Bazel)
3. Stage files with `git add <files>` (do NOT use `git add -A`)
4. Run `git commit` as a separate command (do NOT chain with add)

**Note:** Never use `git commit --amend` if the previous commit has been pushed. If `git status` shows "Your branch is up to date with origin", the last commit is pushed - create a new commit instead.
